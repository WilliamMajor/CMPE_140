# Algorithm:
#
# 1. INPUT n = 5; //given number n
# 2. f = 1;
# 3. while (n > 1)
#    {
#        f = f * n;
#        n = n -1;
#    }
# 4. OUTPUT f; //factorial f = n!
#
# Requirements
# 1. Input number n = 5, to be stored in memory location at address 0x00.
# 2. Register assignment: $a0 = n; $s0 = n!
# 3. You must use the algorithm shown above.
# 4. The assembly program should contain the least amount of instructions possible.
# 5. The factorial of 5 must be written to the memory location at address 0x10.

main:
    # n = 5
    addi $a0, $0, 0x5

    # f = 1
    addi $s0, $0, 0x1

    # set $a1 to 1 for comparison
    addi $a1, $0, 0x1

# Loop checking
check:
    # Check if n == 1
    beq $a0, $a1, output

# Loop beginning
loop:
    mult $a0, $s0     # f = f * n
    mflo $s0
    sub $a0, $a0, $a1 # n = n - 1
    j check

# Output after loop exits
output:

    sw $s0, 0x10($0)
