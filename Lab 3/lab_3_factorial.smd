# Algorithm:
#
# 1. INPUT n = 5; //given number n
# 2. f = 1;
# 3. while (n > 1)
#    {
#        f = f * n;
#        n = n -1;
#    }
# 4. OUTPUT f; //factorial f = n!
#
# Requirements
# 1. Input number n = 5, to be stored in memory location at address 0x00.
# 2. Register assignment: $a0 = n; $s0 = n!
# 3. You must use the algorithm shown above.
# 4. The assembly program should contain the least amount of instructions possible.
# 5. The factorial of 5 must be written to the memory location at address 0x10.
